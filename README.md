## About the Project

The main motive for this project was to create a solution to fulfill the need to keep track of people located in different areas in Helsinki. We got this idea from an outside source which was a sort of partner during this Ohjelmistoprojekti 2 -course. They presented us a few ideas and thoughts and among them was a thought of keeping track of the traveller flows in Helsinki. This need of getting data about people present in different locations seemed to be a good fit for this course and that's why we ended up sticking with it. 

We bounced around a couple of ideas on how to build the solution. Eventually we decided to go with Bluetooth technology because it seemed to be the best way to get data on how many people approximately are in some specific location.
