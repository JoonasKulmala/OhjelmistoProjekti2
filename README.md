## About the Project

The main motive for this project was to create a solution to fulfill the need to keep track of people located in different areas in Helsinki. We got this idea from an outside source which was a sort of partner during this Ohjelmistoprojekti 2 -course. They presented us a few ideas and thoughts and among them was a thought of keeping track of the traveller flows in different locations.
